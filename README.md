# kh-yolo
## Features

- This is a face-mask recognition program developed based on yolov5.
- You can use it to detect faces or faces wearing masks.
- As long as the storage path of the image to be recognized needs to be input, the recognition result can be obtained.
- It relies on some machine learning environments to run, such as pytorch that you can look for them in Requirements.txt

> The only function of this program is to recognize faces and face masks
> so it is very simple and simple, and aims to solve problems quickly.
> This is very useful in COVID-19's wreaking havoc today.


## Tech

- The course uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [pytorch] - useing to realize machine learning.
- [numpy] - awesome matrix tool.
- [yolov5] - awesome Target recognition tool
- and so on...

And of course itself is open source on GitHub.


## Usage

- Download and run it in pycharm.
- Enter the file path where the picture is located.


## Authors and acknowledgment

Thanks to the authors of the open source course and the tutorials shared on the Internet ï¼Œotherwise I can't complete this work with my meager ability
